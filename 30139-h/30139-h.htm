<p>The state of Washington, most northwesterly state in the
Union, named for the "Father of His Country" and popularly
called the "Evergreen State," brings greetings.</p>

<p>For all who would behold, at close range, Nature in her most
beautiful expression when all component elements have been
harmoniously combined, these words of welcome are written.
You are invited to come and share the joy that emanates from the
satisfaction of living in a country as nearly perfect as any that
earth has to offer.</p>

<p>In the creation of this region nothing was overlooked that
might appeal to the most fastidious. An empire within itself,
it is provided with all things for ministering both to man's
physical needs and to his innermost longings. All forces have contributed
towards its glory. More careful preparation was never
made for the coming of man in any clime. Mountains that
reach to heaven and echo the music of celestial choirs in their
innumerable streams and waterfalls; valleys and plateaus that
spring into life when pricked by the harrow of the husbandman;
forests of big trees, perpetually green, to adorn and protect;
the greatest of oceans to temper with its breezes; inland seas
and azure lakes to embellish and attract&mdash;such are a few of the
elements that make the State of Washington and provide beauteous
homes for its people.</p>

<p>Have you yet discovered that cozy retreat imagined in your
youthful impressionable days, where true happiness is bound to
reign? You can find it here&mdash;a place where wonderful pictures,
real and far grander than the famous paintings of your favorite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
artist, are constantly visible from your kitchen window or from
your work shop&mdash;and they need no expensive frames to enhance
their loveliness and no dusting to prevent their obscurity.</p>

<p>What are your favorite pastimes? Are you one of the
brave mountaineers who must yearly draw near the Almighty,
and dare the elements by treading dangerous yet entrancing
trails to heights where the world appears at your feet?
Do you love to cruise in a little yacht built to accommodate
yourself and a few well chosen friends, or motor over scenic
highways to places of interest both near and far? Do you
regard yourself a mighty hunter and desire so to convince
your friends? Or would you be content to angle for the finny
denizens of the deep with a certainty that you will not in turn
be tantalized?</p>

<p>The state of Washington affords unusual opportunity for
all these. Its mountains, glaciers and waterfalls are not excelled
by the
most boasted
scenes of
Switzerland.</p>


<p>Almost the
year round the
waters of
Puget Sound
and the harbors
of the
southwest invite
the small
craft. Nearly
50,000 miles
of scenic
highway, passable for twelve months in succession, are ready for
your automobiles. Game, both large and small, feathered and
hoofed, will lure you through many a jungle of delicate fern and
sweet scented bramble; while countless streams and lakes teem
with fish of many species.</p>

<p>Picturesque parks, dazzling sunsets, roaring ocean surf,
cozy camping sites, beach parties and clam bakes, college regattas,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
midwinter fairs, roses at Christmas, golf the year round on
turf that's always green&mdash;these are a few of the charms that are
as common in the state of Washington as sands in the Sahara,
or ice at the Poles.</p>

<p>If you are drawn by none of these, but desire only to satisfy
that exalted yet mysterious feeling which lurks in everyone's
breast, becoming manifest when the greatest works of the firmament
are beheld, then by all means visit this the "Evergreen
State" and drink in the glories which no book, howe'er so well
written, and no picture, whoe'er the artist, can portray with any
degree of fullness or accuracy.</p>

<p>Washington is a region of variety and strong contrasts.
At one moment you may be jostled along the streets of some
metropolitan center among people of many nationalities and
within a mere hour or so be wafted to a sequestered spot of transcendent
beauty, where no voice but your own is echoed by the
hills and where the existence of any other human being to share
this planet can be completely forgotten.</p>

<p>It is a state of large accomplishments. Big projects are
planned: mammoth irrigation schemes are carried out; lands
are reclaimed from the deep; orchards fill its valleys; wheat
plateaus extend for miles; salmon traps line the shores; its
lumber supplies the world; its ships sail all the seas; monstrous
bridges cross the waterways; buildings vie with the highest anywhere
constructed; its schools rank first in the Union; its men
contribute to the world's greatness; its women vote and rear
capable families; the people make their own laws. Loyalty,
originality, enterprise, independence and liberality, all attributes
of the western spirit, are evident throughout the state.</p>

<p>Its population has grown in twenty odd years from 343,000
to over 1,400,000. In the meantime, wildernesses have been converted
into gardens, villages have developed into towns, while
towns have grown into cities, taking their places among the
leading marts of the world. From a frontier state it has come
to be one of the greatest and most important in the Union, adding
to the galaxy of stars one of the brightest that has yet appeared
on the horizon.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most prominent feature which attracts the eye
of a visitor upon his arrival in the Pacific Northwest consists
of the mountain ranges with their towering snowcapped peaks,
forming, as it were, ladders reaching from the green vales of
earth to the blue vaults of heaven. Silhouetted against the sky
in the hazy distance, they are noted by the westward bound traveler
as soon as he reaches the highest point in the divide of the
Rockies, while to the mariner groping his way eastward upon
the Pacific Ocean they offer the first evidence of the nearness of
the welcome land.</p>

<p>These mountains mean much to the state of Washington,
both for their scenic grandeur and for the favorable influence
they exert on the climate and on the lives of the people who
build their homes in the valleys below. Their supremacy is reflected
by the thermometer, the barometer, and the aerometer;
for they help regulate the temperature, the rainfall, and the
wind's velocity. They form great repositories for the waters
that feed the streams and keep full the cities' aqueducts. Within
their immeasurable depths lie buried huge deposits of precious
and useful metals, besides vast fields of bituminous coal. Their
lower zones provide fertile and safe localities for the growth of
Washington's big timber, while the alpine meadows above secure
for the timid deer and ptarmigan asylums of temporary
freedom from too frequent disturbance by prowling huntsmen.
Still higher are the rugged bare prominences, reserved for the
wild goat or mountain sheep, and the snow fields traversed by
the more venturesome seeking to gain the summits. Everywhere
the true sportsman finds ample opportunity for proving his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
prowess, while trailing the beast to its lair, and the sight-seeking
mountaineer is fully rewarded for all the struggle required to
reach some dizzy height.</p>



<p>Within the immense bosoms of these mountains nestle innumerable
lakes, beauteous beyond compare, near whose shady
shores is many a sequestered spot, most tempting to the camper
who loves the mountain region; and many a brook goes trickling
over its stony course to join the rivers below, pausing here and
there in some shady dell to create a deep pool for luring the fisherman,
or hurling itself over some lofty precipice as a waterfall
of wonderful magnitude and magnificence.</p>

<p>The mountains are a link connecting us with the past. They
remind us perhaps of the period when volcanoes belched forth
their fiery refuse, or of the era when the sea covered most of
what is now land. Indestructible they stand and their rocky
heights are in places insurmountable. The works of man trespass
everywhere else, but these huge pillars of the ages rise in their
majestic splendor and with sublime dignity seem to say: "Thus
far and no further! We will preserve and guard your water
and fuel supply. We will protect you from the furies of the
elements and produce materials for building your palaces. We
will create charming nooks where you may camp under the
clear sky, and shady forests where you may pursue the chase.
We will fill the brooks with swift darting fish; carpet the
meadows with myriads of flowers, ferns, and shrubs; and paint
you pictures undreamt of by men who have scorned our
acquaintance. You are permitted to build roads whereby your
Pullmans and your automobiles may cross to the other side, but
not one of our number shall be moved nor its form be changed
in the least, except by that same invisible power at whose mighty
will we were brought into existence."</p>

<p>Each mountain range possesses its own distinct characteristics.
Of least importance, but none the less beautiful, are
the Blue Mountains in the southeastern corner of the state,
providing pleasant summer retreats for the people in that
vicinity. The Olympic range practically envelopes the Olympic
Peninsula and all but encroaches upon the agricultural lands
lying between the foothills and the salt waters on three sides.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
In this range are the most rugged mountains in Washington,
presenting some of the wildest and most inspiring scenery anywhere
to be found.</p>

<p>Most prominent and of greatest importance in the geography
of the state are the Cascades, having an average altitude of from
5,000 to 8,000 feet and named for the many hurrying streams
that have cut their deep courses upon the shady slopes. They
extend from the British Columbia line slightly southwest until
divided by the Columbia river, whence they continue through
Oregon and become the Sierra Nevadas of California. By them
the state of Washington is separated into two quite distinct
parts, known as Eastern and Western Washington, the former
comprising a portion of the great Inland Empire. Forming a
sort of spur on their east side, north of the Columbia, and extending
to the mountains of Idaho are the beautiful rolling hills
known as the Okanogan Highlands from 5,000 to 6,000 feet in
altitude without sharp abrupt prominences and bearing on their
higher surfaces forests of pine.</p>

<p>Throughout the Cascade range several prominent peaks
tower above the others like giants among dwarfs. The loftiest
by far is Mount Rainier (or Mount Tacoma), second highest
mountain in the United States proper, 14,408 feet in altitude
and the chief mountain resort out of Seattle and Tacoma;
Mount Adams, 12,307 feet, on the boundary line of Skamania
and Yakima counties; Mount St. Helens, 9,697 feet high, at
the western edge of Skamania county, reached from Castle
Rock or Vancouver; Mount Baker, 10,730 feet, forty miles
from Bellingham and one of its main attractions; Mount
Stuart, 9,470 feet, in Chelan county; and Glacier Peak,
10,436 feet, in Snohomish county. In this latitude 7,500 feet
is the snow-line, but Washington has many peaks above that
elevation. Fifty-seven have already been named and measured.</p>

<p>All these peaks are accessible and, together with Mount
Olympus in the Olympics, constitute the main goals of the mountain
loving clubs of the northwest. Mountain phenomena are displayed
in all with a maximum degree of grandeur, insuring ample
reward to those venturing to explore their many fastnesses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Dense forests of evergreen trees almost envelop the hills and
mountains of the state of Washington. Scarcely any portions
were originally left bare, excepting the higher peaks, which in a
spirit of independence seem to have pushed their bald heads
up and above this beautiful covering protecting the regions below.
Into the fertile valleys and along the river banks clear to
the sea the stately ranks of these forests once advanced, but
such localities are now, for the most part, given over to the
cities and the husbandmen or else in a state of semi-transformation
are awaiting the day when they too will be devoted to the
peaceful pursuits of agriculture; for the broad Columbia plain
was the only part of the state dedicated from the first to the sole
task of producing food supplies rather than fuel and building
material.</p>

<p>About ten million acres of these forests have been locked up
in eleven national reserves, and set aside for our future needs,
or to insure permanent haunts where Nature may always be seen
in her full pristine glory&mdash;Conservation! Nearly six million
acres more are under private ownership. Investigation reveals
evidences that their birth occurred very many years ago, possibly
five hundred or even six hundred years; for that many rings
have been counted on some of the largest trees. The foliage
appears every month in the year just as beautiful as when it
first mingled with the landscape&mdash;hence the name "Evergreen
State."</p>

<p>The effect produced by this verdant growth upon the scenery
of the state of Washington can be best realized by climbing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to one of the heights overlooking the timber line. From here
one can readily see how perfectly it hides every blemish of the
irregular contour, blending beautifully with the blue waters in
the distance and the pale clouds floating above. Thousands of
greenish tints are distinguishable, shading from a light yellowish
tinge to a deep prismatic blue, while occasionally a streak of
bright red or a touch of pure white lends a striking contrast.</p>

<p>Leaving the point of vantage, however, to delve into its
midst, breathing in the aromatic odors from the balsams and
cedars, it is easy to note hundreds of interesting distinctions in
size, form, color, and variety, for</p>

<div class='poem'>
"No tree in all the grove but has its charms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Though each its hue peculiar."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>One should know, too, that he is buried in one of the densest
forests of the temperate zone; while standing proudly on every
side are individual giants, which for size can be duplicated nowhere
else in the world, excepting by occasional specimens of
the famous Red Woods of California.</div>

<p>These sturdy monarchs have all been honored with names and
thoroughly worthy of their names they are, without a blemish to
mar their fame in spite of the ages through which they have lived.
Most prominent is the Douglas Fir, or Douglas Spruce (Pseudotsuga
taxifolia), the giant of the forest, growing erect as a
plumb-line until it ends in a pyramidal crown two hundred feet
or more above the ground. This is the most important tree of
the state, for its product houses the people, and for the past ten
years has insured Washington first place in lumber production in
the United States. Some of the largest trees reach the enormous
proportions of eight, ten, and even twelve feet in diameter, a
single one producing material sufficient to build a palace of huge
dimensions.</p>




<p>Of great importance also is the "Red Cedar," reaching sometimes
a height of 200 feet and having a diameter in rare cases
of over 20 feet; yielding for the state of Washington two-thirds
of all the shingles produced in the United States. Similar to
the Cypress, its sweet soporific scent is everywhere conspicuous
and always pleasing. Other trees which provide lumber and add
grace to the Washington woods are the hemlocks, spruces,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
larches, and white firs, in the western part of the state; and the
pines and tamaracs in a number of the eastern counties.</p>

<p>Many other species, of minor commercial value, are sprinkled
throughout the forest in sufficient plentifulness to complete the
artistic design. There are the wide-leafed maples; the red barked
madronas; the pale barked quivering cottonwoods and their allies,
the bitter tasting willows; the white flowered dogwood,
prominent throughout the forests until late in the spring, and
occasionally found blooming in the fall; the gray barked alder
protecting the springs and mountain streams; the sturdy oaks,
skirting the gravelly prairies; the long lived juniper; and the
hardy Scotch broom; besides various other trees and shrubs.
Many of these are so beautiful that landscape gardeners find
nothing more suitable for decorating lawns or lining the city
parks and boulevards.</p>

<p>Here and there are many trees, shrubs and vines that seem to
have been destined especially to yield food for the natural
wanderers of the forests; for it is intended that nothing shall be
wanted in the state of Washington. There is probably no other
section of the world where wild berries grow in greater profusion.
Very prominent is the wild cherry, the wild apple, the
salmon berry, the thimble berry, the huckleberry, the salal berry,
the Oregon grape, the blackberry, the strawberry, the wild
currant, and the raspberry.</p>

<p>Hiding within the shade of these, playing hide and seek
with nature lovers who enjoy threading the romantic trails for
which this section of the world is noted, is many a modest flower
which in some sections blooms nearly the whole year round, so
soft is the climate; while the pink petaled rhododendron, of
bolder nature, Washington's state flower, is prominent in June
tossing its beautiful head among the dry logs and lining the
course of many a pretty driveway.</p>

<p>Penetrating everywhere and saturating the atmosphere with
its sweetness, may be heard the music of some rippling stream
winding its happy way down the mountain side and playing, as
it were, an accompaniment to the duets of soul mated song birds
unable to restrain their songs of joy. If this is a wilderness
then a wilderness is a paradise on earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>People considering a change of residence or a vacation trip
are always interested in the climate of the locality attracting
their attention, for they know that absolute contentment in any
clime, even for a brief period, is impossible without a friendly
attitude on the part of the elements. So many regions seem to
have been permanently blighted by conditions opposed to human
happiness, or at least to have been forgotten in certain important
essentials when Nature was passing round her favors.</p>

<p>The state of Washington, however, received a full share
of climatic blessings as well as scenic beauties. Without extremes
either of heat or cold its climate is as temperate as that
of southern England&mdash;a most remarkable fact when one realizes
that its latitude is higher than that of the state of Maine
and its northern boundary line corresponds to that of North
Dakota and Minnesota. Such equability is caused chiefly by
the protecting mountains and their dense forests together with
the breezes blowing direct from the ocean and warmed by the
mysterious Japan Current.</p>

<p>So uniform is the general temperature, excepting in the
mountainous regions, that the same weight of clothing is by
many found sufficient the year round. In every section there is
a long growing season and only a short mild winter, known on
the west side as the "rainy season." There is never danger
from blizzards or intense "cold waves," for these are deflected to
the country east of the Rockies. Trees retain their green foliage
the year round; in most parts there is usually some pasture
available every month; and in certain sections many varieties of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
flowers will be found blooming outdoors in January. Cattle
may be turned loose almost any day in the year and the farmer
is saved the necessity of spending all his summer's profits in
order that his livestock will not starve during a long cold period.
The lowest monthly normal temperature, as deduced from a
period of years, is for Seattle, 39&deg;; Spokane, 27&deg;; and Walla
Walla, 33&deg;. Contrast these with the normal temperatures of
the following cities for the same month: Duluth, 10&deg;; St. Paul,
12&deg;; Des Moines, 20&deg;; and Chicago, 24&deg;.</p>

<p>The summers may be considered ideal. A breeze is generally
stirring. There are no sunstrokes, for even in the warmest
parts the dryness of the atmosphere favors evaporation. The
nights are everywhere cool. When millions in other climes are
rolling about in their torturous beds, struggling for the relief
that sleep alone can impart, the Washingtonian doffs his
clothes, tucks himself comfortably between his cozy quilts, and
is soon wafted into the land of nod from which he awakes in the
morning refreshed and ready for life's battle.</p>

<p>The same forces that affect the temperature and precipitation
also offer protection against the extraordinary meteorological
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'occurences'">occurrences</ins> that so often terrorize the people in more
exposed regions. "The Weather Bureau has no authentic record
of a real tornado anywhere in the state of Washington" says
G. N. Salisbury, Washington Section Director of the U. S.
Weather Bureau. Violent thunderstorms are in most parts unknown.
Loss of life never occurs from any of these causes.
The atmosphere is always pure and salubrious and the death

<p>One glorious expanse of calm picturesque water is the great
inland sea known as Puget Sound, extending from the Strait of
Juan de Fuca far into the interior of the state of Washington.
If the Strait mentioned, together with Hood Canal and a portion
of the Strait of Georgia are included, and they will be in
this article, nearly 2,000 square miles of mirror like surface are
encompassed within the green wooded shore lines of as many
lineal miles. With sinuous arms, these waters reach in every
direction, reflecting in their depths sometimes the lofty mountains,
at other times gardens and farms of unusual attractiveness,
and again the modern cities located upon the shores.</p>

<p>Almost everywhere have been sprinkled pretty emerald isles
beckoning with all the lure of nature, while tree bedecked peninsulas
shelter hundreds of cuddling coves. Near the dividing
shore line the "tide lands" reach out from the sunny beaches and
supply a sort of neutral ground, enjoyed now by the clam
diggers or oyster culturists and again claimed by the enveloping
waters.</p>

<p>Rising gently from the water's edge broad areas of fertile
lands, which have been released from their forest burdens, are
now devoted to the pursuits of husbandry and yield liberally
to feed the multitudes dwelling in the neighboring large cities.
Here and there patches of virgin growth in primeval splendor
may still be seen, but usually, excepting in the Hood Canal
region, the forests have been forced back to the foot hills, leaving
in their wake the so-called logged-off areas which are in turn
rapidly giving away to meadows and orchards. Further back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to the east and west the mountains stand guard, while innumerable
streams with incalculable water power pierce their sides,
transect the lower levels, and pour the sweets of the mountainous
regions out into the salts of the deep.</p>

<p>Occasionally rocky bluffs or promontories stand boldly out
of the water, and command the view for miles in every
direction. Pictures are everywhere presented which reproduced
on canvass would insure the immortality of any artist.
Altogether the region presents the likeness of one vast kingly
garden where every plant that will grow is nurtured and all
wonders combine to enchant the visitor.</p>

<span class="caption">SUMMER TIME PLEASURES.</span>
</div>

<p>This beauteous sea is not locked away behind impenetrable
bulwarks of mountain walls, like many of nature's wonders, but
is at the very door of the people and enjoyed by them while
going about
their daily
tasks. Nearly a
million human
beings look out
upon its placid
waters and rejoice
at their
good fortune
in being permitted
to play,
as it were, upon
its banks,
and to feel the tender caresses of the soft whispering breezes
that make the region such a pleasure ground in summer, and a
haven in winter&mdash;and there is room for ten times as many to
make their homes where these same joys may be experienced.</p>

<p>Not in the lifetime of an individual, nor even in the period
required for the most extravagant display of human skill, was
this great pleasure resort created. Ages elapsed, say geologists,
between the rising of the waters that "drowned" the rivers once
flowing where now the Sound reposes and the advent of the
glaciers which deposited the fertile sediment to nourish the
luxuriant growth appearing on every hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'><br />IDEAL FOR YACHTING AND CRUISING.</div>

<p>One can pass the entire summer on Puget Sound without seeing
a bit of rough weather. The largest ocean liners ride here
safe from the storms that pound sometimes against the outer
coast line; for its waters compose one great harbor, protected
by the forests and mountains. One may see "Uncle Sam's"
powerful fighting machines almost any day steaming toward
Bremerton, one of the U. S. Naval Stations, where the largest
dry dock owned by the U. S. Government is located.</p>

<p>But this peaceful body of water is not for the big vessels
alone. It could not have been improved if created especially for
the yacht, the motor launch, the row boat and even the venturesome
canoe. Upon its surface is held many a local speed contest,
and the annual power boat race is run from Ketchikan,
Alaska, to Seattle. Conditions here are ideal for the college
regatta and for the difficult feats of the hydroplane. During
festive days many important events are pulled off, while the
happy spectators, dressed in holiday attire, are crowded along
the water's edge or perched on the ridges and house tops above.</p>

<p>For cruising, no waters in the world offer such advantages&mdash;never
threatened by tempests and always within reach of some
of nature's most glorious beauty spots. Landing places suitable
for camps are easily found, from which short inland excursions
may be made through alpine meadows by winding trails to the
summit of some mountain or to the shores of some peaceful lake.</p>
<p>Those who are not fortunate enough to have their own craft
are not necessarily deprived of enjoying these waters; for regular
passenger steamers, of ample capacity and stately appearance
make regular trips throughout the year from every city on
its shores to nearly every other part of the Sound; while special
summer time excursions are made from the metropolitan centers
to all the principal points of interest on Puget Sound and
to the cities of British Columbia and Alaska.</p>



<div class='center'><br />HOOD CANAL.</div>

<p>The waters that put one in closest touch with the mountains
are in the narrow channel, or fiord, known as Hood Canal, extending
southwesterly and bending back into the heart of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Kitsap Peninsula. Tourists riding over these waters for the
first time are elated with the splendors, and the frequent visitor
never tires of the inspiring scenes that everywhere greet the
eye. The eastern shores reveal the neat farms and settlements
in Kitsap and Mason counties, while the western edge
is at the very foot of the Olympic range, whose white serrated
ridges are continually visible from the deck of a passing
steamer. Easily distinguishable also are the deep canyons
cut by the several main streams working their way towards
the canal, plunging over rocky cliffs and creating falls
of exquisite beauty. The Little and Big Quilcene, the Dusewallips,
the Duckabush, the Hamma Hamma, and the Lilliwago, are
some of the mountain streams whose canyons with rugged trails
are familiar to those making frequent pilgrimages thither.</p>

</div>

<p>Other attractive places are Lake Cushman, a mountain
summer resort reached from Hoodsport, and the rich Skokomish
valley containing the Indian reservation of the same name. At
Union City one may take the stage over a well traveled road
through groves and vales to Shelton, county seat of Mason
county, where regular steamers connect with all Puget Sound
points&mdash;thus encircling the Kitsap Peninsula.</p>


<div class='center'><br />OTHER TRIPS.</div>

<p>Equally delightful are the little voyages over the main
traveled waters of the Sound from Seattle or Tacoma to Olympia
and Shelton, to Bremerton, Everett, Bellingham, Anacortes,
Port Townsend, and Port Angeles; also out to the ocean or
through the San Juan Islands to Victoria and Vancouver in
British Columbia. The mountains are always in sight although
not so close as on the Canal trip, and there passes a continual
procession of groves, hills, pebbly beaches, rocky palisades, gardens,
orchards, green meadows, and summer homes.</p>

<p>Entrancing is the view at the sun's rising or setting when a
myriad shades of reddish and bluish tints are painted on the
hovering clouds, which assume various grotesque shapes above
the shimmering waters; and even at night time when threading
the channel marked by the twinkling beacon lights, or entering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the harbor of a city resplendent with thousands of glittering incandescents.</p>

</div></div>


<div class='center'><br />COMMERCE.</div>

<p>Besides scenes that appeal chiefly to the esthetic are many
that suggest the state's commercial importance, for these waters
produce many million dollars worth of fish each year, and the
neighboring shores have the largest saw mills in the world, supplying
a big share of the 4,000,000,000 feet of lumber which is
Washington's annual contribution and insures her first place in
the Union. Out from Bellingham and Anacortes may be observed
the rare spectacle of huge fish traps being raised, with sometimes
50,000 Puget Sound salmon wiggling within their meshes, soon
to be preserved in the largest canneries of the world and shipped
to all corners of the globe. Big ocean liners heavily laden are
seen in the harbors or met upon the waters, carrying away cargoes
of manufactured products which for the entire state approaches
the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'stupenduous'">stupendous</ins> sum of $300,000,000 yearly.</p>


<div class='center'><br />THE EAST SHORES.</div>

<p>The loudest buzz of commercialism is to be heard on the east
shores, where fertile valleys and sightly plateaus checkered with
farms and gardens stretch away to the foot hills of the Cascade
Mountains, comprising five of the most densely populated counties
in the state. Here, too, are four of Washington's five largest
cities, Seattle, Tacoma, Everett and Bellingham, each the center
of a rich territory supporting numerous smaller cities. At the
southern limit is Olympia, the state capital.</p>

<p>Without irrigation the region yields liberally of fruits, berries,
vegetables, hay, oats, dairy and poultry products, which
go to support those engaged in the lumbering, fishing, ship
building, mining, and other manufacturing industries, and the
diversified business pursuits.</p>

<p>Eight transcontinental railroads operate trains, an almost
unbroken string of electric railways render good local service,
while excellent roads, including the Pacific Highway, crisscross
the section and unite the people with indestructible bonds of
friendship and mutual interests.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>A number of lakes beautify this region, as well as the other
parts of the Puget Sound country. The largest is Lake Washington,
one of the grandest in the west, twenty miles in length,
forming the eastern boundary to Seattle, providing sites
for country homes and parks, and embellishing its boulevard
system. Near Bellingham is Lake Whatcom, of similar importance
to that city. Lake Stevens is handy to Everett, and a number
of smaller ones are tributary to Tacoma.</p>


<div class='center'><br />THE ISLANDS.</div>

<p>Puget Sound would not be nearly so interesting without the
many enchanting isles dotting its surface from Olympia to
Blaine and within easy reach of the cities located upon its
shores. Some are hidden within partially concealed bays and
others appear like portions of the mainland until circumnavigation
has proved their seclusion. Although a few have sufficient
area and commercial importance to form entire counties,
the larger number are of rather small compass, and a few are
tiny gems suitable only for private resorts away from the busy
cities. Nearly all are clothed in evergreen trees, bespangled
with flowers and ferns, and girdled with gravelly beaches suggesting
the real charms of camp life.</p>


<div class='center'><br />SAN JUAN GROUP.</div>

<p>Travelers agree that no islands anywhere are more beautiful
than the San Juan group, blocking the entrance to the Straits
of Georgia, rivaling as they do the Thousand Isles of the St.
Lawrence or the classical Grecian Archipelago. There are
172 of them, including 122 with names suggesting their own
peculiarities and others known chiefly by their location and shown
only on the mariner's chart. The largest are San Juan, Orcas
and Lopez. Apart from them but closer to the mainland are
Lummi, Guemes, and Cypress, similar in formation and of like
attractiveness. They are approachable with almost any kind of
craft, no great distances separate them, and often there is just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
passage for a steamer. They offer rare opportunity for playing
hide and seek on the water, a game which in days gone by men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
played in earnest; for the smuggler stealing away from the international
boundary line found within their shady inlets havens of
safety from the unfriendly eye of "Uncle Sam's" revenue cutter.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 344px;">

<span class="caption"><a href="images/illo_p034-big.jpg">AMONG THE SAN JUAN ISLANDS.</a><br />Photos by J. A. McCormick.</span>
</div>

<p>And only to think, these islands were nearly lost to us!
Had it not been for the wise decision of William I. of Germany in
1871, the Union Jack instead of the beloved Stars and Stripes
might today be floating over them. The two distinct camps
on San Juan Island where the British "Red Coats" and
the American "Blues" waited and watched from 1860 to 1872,
are still protected as points of interest; the former near Roche
Harbor, and the latter near Friday Harbor, the county seat.</p>

<p>The usual way to reach them is by steamer from Seattle,
Bellingham or Anacortes. The boat stops at all the main towns
including Friday Harbor, where the University Marine Station
and two large salmon canneries are located; Roche Harbor,
where one of the largest lime kilns is prospering; and Deer Harbor,
West Sound, East Sound, Rosario, Olga, and Doebay, attractive
as summer resorts.</p>

<p>Many people spend their summers among these isles. The
tourist with limited time should, besides visiting the historic
sites on San Juan, make a trip to Mount Constitution on Orcas
Island. Two good wagon roads lead all the way to the top, the
one from East Sound and the other from Olga. A pleasant day's
outing is enjoyed by going up one way and returning by the
other. Its altitude, 2,408 feet, is nothing compared with the
peaks in the Cascades. Nevertheless, few places offer more comprehensive
outlooks. On the descent it will be difficult for the
"wise" to resist the temptation to pass through Rosario, the
beautiful country estate belonging to Robert Moran, a retired
Seattle ship builder, who has harnessed the water power from the
lakes lying a few hundred feet above and equipped a modern
mansion with all that man can desire or money and art can supply.
Who would guess that a great pipe organ might be heard
in this seemingly remote spot in the universe, bursting out in
unexcelled magnificence, rendering the masterpieces of the great
composers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />WHIDBY ISLAND.</div>

<p>Extending about fifty miles in front of Skagit and Snohomish
counties, midway in the Sound where the views of the Cascades
and the Olympics are unobstructed, is Whidby Island, the
second largest island in the United States proper and sometimes
called "The Long Island of Puget Sound." With Camano Island
on the east and two other very small ones it constitutes an
independent county. Having much water front and its western
shore facing the straits where direct breezes from the ocean are
felt, it draws many campers from the cities. There are no
mountains to climb, although a number of eminences offer views
of the distant landscape.</p>

<p>The largest improvement has been near the southern extremity
and between Coupeville and the northern limits, where the
world's record for wheat production per acre was made. A
beautiful road decorated with rhododendrons leads from Fort
Casey to Deception Pass separating it from Fidalgo Island on
the north, which is connected with the mainland by a first class
highway. Near Coupeville is Still Park, where summer Chautauquas
are held and many campers congregate.</p>


<div class='center'><br />OTHER ISLANDS.</div>

<p>A few minutes' ride out of Seattle is Bainbridge Island, having
forty miles of water front lined with summer homes or suitable
for camping sites. Tributary to both Seattle and Tacoma
are Vashon and Maury Islands, practically one, comprising some
twenty-three thousand acres, which yield for these cities berries,
fruits, vegetables, and flowers, and offer some of the most delightful
sites for homes along their fifty miles of attractive shore
line.</p>

<p>Fox, Anderson, and McNeils Islands are integral parts of
the Bay Island country, a rich district tributary to Tacoma and
offering unlimited opportunities for campers who are always
welcomed by the hospitable ranchers. Hartstine Island maintains
one of the largest vineyards in the west, yielding delicious
grapes which find their way to distant eastern markets. Numerous
smaller islands are scattered about the Sound and insure
pleasant retreats for all that love the simple life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'><br />OLYMPIC PENINSULA.</div>

<p>Lying between Hood Canal and the Pacific Ocean and extending
from the Strait of Juan de Fuca southward toward the
Chehalis river valley is the vast Olympic Peninsula, whose resources
and wonders are probably less known than almost any
other section of the world. The central portion constitutes one
great forest reserve within which is the Olympic National Monument
set apart by the government for the enjoyment of nature
lovers. The population is distributed among the cities and towns
situated on the level lands skirting the waterfront. This Monument
contains the most rugged mountains, the deepest canyons,
the most turbulent rivers and the thickest forests in the state.</p>

<p>The Peninsula is now reached both by steamer and automobile.
Highways lead well up into the foothills from the cities
of Port Angeles, Sequim, Port Townsend, Quilcene, Shelton,
Aberdeen, Hoquiam, and Hood Canal points, and passable
trails thread their way to the summits beyond. It is easy to
surprise both deer and elk, confident of safety from the approach
of man. Numerous flowering parks display seas of gorgeous
colors which make the region famous for its beauty.</p>

<p>It also serves as a huge treasure chest. Billions of feet of
choicest timber remain uncut; valuable ore veins and a vast lake
of petroleum are buried within its depths; land well suited for
agriculture girdles the entire peninsula; and the neighboring
waters yield liberal quantities of fish.</p>

<p>Certain beauty spots in the mountains have been supplemented
with the conveniences and luxuries of modern invention.
Among these are Sol Duc Springs, at the headwaters of the Sol
Duc river, where a little palace has been lifted into the mountains,
Government Hot Springs, and Lake Crescent, all reached
from Port Angeles; Lake Cushman, approached from Hoodsport;
and Lake Quiniault, north of Grays Harbor. A visit to
any of these resorts or any part of the peninsula will satisfy
the most extravagant expectations of tourist and mountaineer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Everybody in the state of Washington knows about the
"Harbor Country," the only part of the state where almost
simultaneously one may enjoy the rare combination of the unobstructed
ocean, an inland sea, and trout streams lined with
giant firs and cedars, which all but encroach upon the dominions
of the waters. Here the oyster, the clam and the crab seemingly
try to outdo one another and the mighty forest, in yielding
splendid profits to the people, who lend every encouragement to
the remarkable competition.</p>

<p>Thousands from the larger cities hie themselves to this section,
at least once during the summer, to feast their eyes upon
another variety of scenery, to enjoy its peculiar attractions, and
experience again the pleasure of riding through a valley that
appeals alike to the Pullman passenger and to the automobilist;
for it is human nature to love a change, even if one's home environment
approaches perfection itself.</p>

</div>
<p>There are two important salt water harbors in southwest
Washington, the more northerly one in Chehalis county, and
named Grays Harbor after the great explorer who discovered
it in 1792, and the southern one in Pacific county bearing an
Indian name, Willapa Bay. They are separated by only a
few miles of territory, which is served by no railroad other than
a short logging road. Regular traffic is usually around by Centralia,
excepting that during the summer months auto stages
traverse the beach from Cohasset to Tokeland; for the beach
here is level and broad, and the sands packed so firm, when the
tide has receded, that it is used as a highway, and even as a race
track for automobiles and motorcycles. This is true not only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
of the portion lying between the two harbors but also of the
twenty-five miles known as "North Beach" extending from
Willapa Bay to the mouth of the Columbia.</p>

<p>The entire region is fraught with charms that can be duplicated
nowhere else. Pacific, Moclips and Cohasset beaches are
patronized especially by people from the Sound cities and from
southwest Washington. North Beach to the south of Willapa
Bay attracts as well crowds from Portland and other Oregon
cities. On Sundays or at week ends special excursions are numerous,
when great crowds avail themselves of the opportunity
of visiting the seashore.</p>

<p>The modes of amusement are numerous. Wading and bathing
in the surf or burrowing in the warm sands; hunting for
shells, agates, and
Indian relics; rowing,
and trolling for
salmon; or searching
for the rare floral
specimens abounding
in the neighboring
woods occupy the
time of many.
Others enjoy visiting
the canneries, observing the motor races, or watching the
sailing vessels, with canvas inflated, gliding quietly into the
harbor or, heavily laden, being dragged out across the bar by
some fretful yet powerful tug boat. Then there are the clam
bakes and, at the end of the day, the big bonfires, the beach
parties and the story telling, after which one is lulled into sweet
slumber by the unceasing roar of the ocean surf.</p>

<p>So fascinating is this region that its extensive ocean beach
will undoubtedly in time be ornate with one continuous array
of summer resorts reaching from Ilwaco on Baker's Bay, at the
mouth of the Columbia, to Neah Bay at the entrance to the
Straits, and interrupted only by the narrow gaps marking the
entrances to the two harbors. Every manner of dwelling is
provided for those who wish to stay several weeks. Cottages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
may be rented, camping sites engaged, or board obtained at one
of the homelike hotels looking out upon the sea.</p>


<div class='center'><br />GRAYS HARBOR.</div>

<p>To reach Grays Harbor, unless approaching from the
ocean, means a trip through the wide fertile valley of the Chehalis
river, either by auto or over one of the three transcontinental
railroads that serve it. The entire journey presents a
panorama of pretty landscapes. The stream itself is conspicuous,
tracing the valley's boundary on one side and again on
the other, as if choosing the most convenient course to the sea.
Sometimes it disappears from view, but its presence is still
marked by clumps of willows and cottonwoods protecting its
banks, and again by some rustic bridge where the highway

<p>More generously the beauties unfold as the valley widens
and the harbor is neared. Quaint towns are seen, including
Oakville, noted for large shipments of cascara bark; Elma, an
industrial center; and Montesano, the county seat and head of
river navigation. Green meadows, wooded slopes, and cultivated
farms on both sides of the river absorb the attention until
Cosmopolis, Aberdeen, and Hoquiam, close by the harbor, are
reached. These cities have experienced a remarkable growth
within the past fourteen years. Aberdeen and Hoquiam have
now a combined population of 29,000 in place of 6,355, the
census returns of 1900. Thoroughly cosmopolitan, they contain
the homes of some of the wealthiest men in the state.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Such development has been due largely to the importance
of the lumber industry which in this section of the state has
assumed large proportions. The ravenous mills, the capacious
yards, and the huge vessels loading for foreign ports are common
sights within the cities. Farther away in the logging
camps the agility of the lumberjack is exhibited as he lays low
the giants of the forest and trims the logs ready for the mills.</p>

<p>The harbor may be most thoroughly appreciated by taking
a ride upon its waters. Regular steamers make the round trip
each day, stopping at many points of interest, both in the north
and the south bay, including the North Jetty under construction
by the United States government, Westport, where the
life saving station and the wireless telegraph station are located,
and Bay City, one of the largest whaling stations in the northwest.
On the same trip the clam and crab fisheries may be
seen. At the week end it is pleasant to get off at Westport and
visit Cohasset Beach, there to enjoy the modern social pastimes
that engage the evenings of the summer dwellers.</p>

<p>Pacific Beach, Moclips, and a number of other ocean resorts
near the terminus of the Northern Pacific, also deserve visits;
while those desiring more strenuous exercise can make profitable
excursions into the wild Olympic region, exploring the forested
hills, visiting the oil prospects, or hunting and fishing.</p>

<p>Splendid highways lead in different directions. In Chehalis
county alone are 325 miles of gravel roads, every part of which
passes near interesting scenes. One road extends to the south
of the harbor and another to the beach resorts at the north.
The Olympic Highway, one of the state primary highways,
leads east to the Sound country, and northward up the Humptulips
Valley, through the big timber to Lake Quiniault, located
in the midst of grand solitude on the edge of the Quiniault Indian
Reservation, making this lake a handy resort for the people
living near Grays Harbor. Those who take the trip should
plan their return so as to include a ride down the Quiniault
River in Indian canoes. The Mountaineers who returned this
way from Mount Olympus in 1913, pronounced it the best part
of the entire outing:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"The trip down the Quiniault river with its manifold beauties
and experiences beggars description&mdash;the swift current, the
whirling eddies, the deep, dark-green water, trout leaping into
the air to catch the flying insects, the banks clothed with magnificent
forests, log jams through which or under which we
passed, animated branches marking the rhythmic motion of the
current, the floating canoes gliding into the deeper, darker
water to seek the current that hurried them on and ever on to
the ocean. The Indians skillfully guided the little craft through
the dangerous places, then settled back to rest until the next
test of skill or strength was necessary, in the meantime relating
bits of history or legends which explained names or some natural
phenomenon. The boom of the surf announced the end of the
journey. As the Mountaineers left the canoes on the beach at
Taholah, it was agreed that the trip down the Quiniault marked
the red-letter day of the 1913 outing."</p>

<p>The water area of this bay is 100 square miles, composed
of two sections, one extending southward and separated
from the ocean by a long narrow
peninsula, nowhere more
than two miles in width, and
the other reaching eastward
to South Bend and Raymond.
Into it flows Willapa river,
besides other short but swift
mountain streams teeming
with trout and other game
fish. The bar is about a mile
wide and the waters covering
it 28-1/2 feet deep at low tide,
thus enabling sea-going vessels
to cross without the aid
of tugs&mdash;a great advantage
to ocean liners and big lumber
schooners, which may be
seen almost any day either lying at the docks or loaded to the
gunwale passing out to sea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>The southern arm approaches within three miles of the Columbia
River. People in Pacific County say that Uncle Sam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
plans to dig a canal through this narrow strip so that vessels
may enter the river by way of Willapa Bay and avoid the Columbia
bar, kept open by jetties built at enormous expense.</p>

<p>The cities of Raymond and South Bend are other examples
of what lumbering and fishing have done for Washington municipalities.
Where a few years ago was nothing but a wilderness,
known only to the Indians or an occasional fisherman, are
now busy marts with extensive waterfront factory sites. Pretty
roads start from these cities and wind along the harbor front
or penetrate the interior. Excursions by water may be made
to Bay Center and Tokeland, summer resorts and fishing stations.
Crab and clam fisheries and the oyster beds may be seen
here to advantage, Tokeland being the place where eastern
oysters were first transplanted for mercantile purposes.</p>

<p>South Bend and Raymond are also starting points for the
North Beach ocean resorts. On this trip one gets a full view
of the bay, and the ocean surf tumbling over the bar. At
Nahcotta, a pretty oyster village, all passengers are transferred
to the O.-W. R. &amp; N. train bound for Ilwaco and Megler,
whence regular steamers cross to Astoria. This train makes
frequent stops, permitting close scrutiny of the attractive
summer cottages that face the boundless ocean constantly
visible on the right.</p>

<p>Located at almost the southern extremity of the peninsula
is the quaint town of Ilwaco, overlooking the Columbia bar.
Near by are the most extensive cranberry marshes in the state.
Another attraction is "North Head," most southwesterly point
in the state of Washington, where an unobstructed view of the
ocean is obtained. From this point may be seen the waters of
the Columbia mixing with the ocean, "Tillamook Head" in
Oregon, the light house, the life-saving station, Fort Canby,
the wireless station, and the "Seal Rocks," where hundreds of
sea lions are usually sunning themselves.</p>

<p>Instead of returning by the same route, the Columbia River
may be chosen to Kalama, whence the Sound Country may be
quickly reached by the Pacific Highway or by rail. Every
tourist should make at least one visit to the Harbor Country
and see the ocean from the southwest corner of the state.</p>

<p>One day, late in summer, I was sitting upon a commanding
promontory nearly 7,000 feet in altitude, entranced by a panoramic
view most wonderful to behold. The sky was clear, the
sun's warm rays were unobstructed, and the air I breathed pure
as the nectar of heaven. Only five hours before I had left the
city of Tacoma and a little earlier Seattle&mdash;two great cities
throbbing with the activities of nearly a half million people engaged
in manufacturing and mercantile pursuits.</p>

<p>Just beyond the foothills visible towards the west were the
green valleys in which these metropolitan centers lay&mdash;the nearest
only forty miles distant by an air line, close to the waters <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'of of'">of</ins>
Puget Sound. Yet here, almost in sight of them, I was enjoying
a quietude known only to the haunts of nature. More
than seven thousand feet above me towered the majestic dome
of the second highest pinnacle in the United <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'State'">States</ins>, reserving
observation to the north until its summit should be reached,
while far toward the east and the south extended range
upon range of mountain peaks, like an army of giants gathered
around their chief. Here and there among them appeared the
sub-chiefs, Adams and St. Helens in Washington; and Hood,
Jefferson, and the Three Sisters, far beyond, in Oregon. Between
their serrated ranks darker shadows marked the deep
canyons where grows some of the choicest timber in the state.</p>

<p>Near by crawled the huge glacial bodies gnawing their way
down the mountain side and splitting its surface into rugged
ridges. Between them and below were spread the meadowed alpine
parks or abandoned cirques&mdash;veritable fairylands&mdash;which
had been carved out by these superhuman agencies eons before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Barely distinguishable was the road by which I had made
the circuitous ascent, bending back and forth across the face
of an apparently perpendicular wall, while the glacial streams
glittering in the sunshine, resembled huge serpents lying in the
profound hollows formed by the extending hills.</p>

<p>The hours spent in reaching this favored point were of themselves
worth the effort. Either rail or automobile may be chosen
to Ashford where each train is met by an auto stage. Leaving
Tacoma, the highway threads a picturesque gravelly prairie
for thirty miles, ascends the beautiful canyon road, crosses the
Ohop Valley, leads to the brink of the Nisqually Canyon a
thousand feet deep, plunges through dense virgin forests,
reaches Longmire, and zigzags to the snout of the Nisqually
Glacier, whence the ascent to the Camp of the Clouds may be
continued afoot, on horseback, or by horse stage.</p>

<p>This region was only recently set aside as a National Park.
Perhaps no other area in the world brings so many and such
varied natural wonders to the very doors of two great cities.
It contains a total of 207,360 acres, or 324 square miles, of
which 100 square miles is occupied by Mount Rainier (or Mt.
Tacoma), king of mountains, rising apparently directly from
sea level, and visible from almost every point in the state.</p>

<p>No grander expression of Nature's sculptural art exists
than this mighty pinnacle, 14,408 feet in altitude, whose glacial
area, no less than 45 square miles in extent, exceeds that of any
other peak in the United States. One of the most interesting
glaciers is Carbon on the north slope, reaching down to a
lower elevation than any other; the most readily reached
is the Nisqually, five miles in length; and the largest is the
White or Emmon's. Other primary glaciers are the Cowlitz,
Ingraham, Winthrop, North and South Mowich, Puyallup,
North and South Tahoma, and the Kautz. The most important
secondary glaciers are Van Trump, Frying-Pan, Stevens, Paradise,
and Interglacier.</p>

<span class="caption"><a href="images/illo_p051-big.jpg">IN MOUNT RAINIER NATIONAL PARK.</a></span>
</div>

<p>The summit may be reached by five different routes. These
are the Paradise Valley, Indian Henry's, the Kautz Glacier,
Ptarmigan Ridge, and Emmon's or the White Glacier route.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
The Paradise Valley (known also as the "Gibraltar") route, on
the south side, is by far the most popular, for it is well provided
with hotel accommodations, and both the government road and
Paradise trail lead right up to the Camp of the Clouds, at the
mountain's foot. It is usual to leave this tented village at midnight,
arriving at Muir Camp (10,062 feet elevation) at about
5 a. m., and Columbia Crest, the highest point on the mountain,
at about 11 a. m. From this celestial height one may see
more than a hundred miles in every direction, far away to the
ocean on the west and into the great Inland Empire on the east.
The snow-capped peaks already noted are seen toward the
south, Mount Olympus to the northwest, and Baker, Shuksan,
Stuart, and Glacier Peak to the north; while the Mother, the
Sluiskin, the Sourdough Mountains, and the Tatoosh Range
near by seem like mere foothills, between eight and nine thousand
feet below. No grander or more inspiring view may be
observed anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>Scaling the peak, however, is a feat undertaken by only a
few, and always with the aid of an experienced guide. The
largest measure of real joy is found in the alpine "parks." The
best known and most frequented is along the Paradise River.
Tributary to it and reached from Longmire, are Indian
Henry's, Van Trump, Cowlitz and Magnetic Parks. Others
requiring more time to visit are Summerland, one of the largest
and most beautiful, Elysian Fields, and Morain, Saint Andrews
and Grand Parks.</p>

<p>Surrounded by rugged peaks and snow fields these natural
amphitheaters present a pleasing contrast. Scarcely any underbrush
exists in them but many beautiful flowers, shrubs, and
trees abound; three hundred distinct plants are said to exist;
pretty lakelets gem their surface; and all are drained by
trickling streamlets or cut by raging rivers producing waterfalls
of rare beauty as they go tumbling from the melting
glaciers to the sea. Excellent trails, built by the government,
lead to every point of interest and extend clear around the
mountain. Camping places are plentiful or accommodations
may be obtained at comfortable hotels.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>This wonderful and majestic river whose history is enhanced
with legend, offers the exploring tourist or curious sight-seer
unusual opportunities to indulge his unbounded imagination
and to satisfy his desire for the spectacular in nature.
Upon its banks were enacted events of greatest importance in
northwest history, while interwoven with the incontrovertible
happenings is many a fascinating Indian story and song. Overlooking
its waters were the first settlements of the Pacific northwest,
upon whose sites are now built, within easy hearing of its
persistent dashings, some of the proudest and most prosperous
cities of the country.</p>

<p>One of the largest rivers on the American continent, with
many important tributaries, it drains a territory equal to five
times the area of the state of Washington. By a series of
cataracts, falls, cascades, and bold turns, it flows nearly 1,400
miles with a total drop of 2,500 feet, before finally delivering
the waters gathered from many sources to the great Pacific
ocean.</p>

<p>Like other great rivers, some portions have needed vast
expenditures to increase its value as a navigable stream. Near
Stevenson the government has built locks at a cost of several
million dollars, enabling large vessels to reach The Dalles, at
present the head of navigation. At Celilo, two hundred miles
from its mouth, where, in twelve miles distance, the river falls
eighty-one feet at low tide, other locks are being constructed.
When these are completed, merchant vessels can go direct from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the sea as far as Priest Rapids, a distance of over four hundred
miles. As many miles additional are navigable, but broken in
places by rapids and falls.</p>

</div>

<p>Important as this river is from a commercial and geographic
standpoint, the greatest interest by far centers in the
phenomena that are of its own creation, visible every mile from
its mouth to its source. A journey upon its surface rivals one
along the historic Rhine, the picturesque Hudson, or the beautiful
St. Lawrence. The panorama includes besides the wilder
grandeurs, economic scenes suggesting the fecundity of the
earth and the industry of the husbandman. To enumerate and
describe these ever so briefly would require an entire volume.
This short chapter is a suggestion only that "By reason of
scenic grandeur, absorbing interest of physical features, the
majesty and mystery of its flow through some of the wildest as
well as some of the most beautiful regions of the globe, and at
the last by the peculiar grandeur of its entrance into the greatest
of the oceans, this 'Achilles of Rivers' attracts alike historian,
scientist, poet, statesman, and lover of nature."</p>

<p>In many places the natural appearances are the same now
as when Gray, Lewis and Clarke, the Astorians and the Northwest
and Hudson's Bay Company men first viewed its banks, with
the exception that the shores have in places been denuded of their
largest timber and either a younger growth has inherited the
dominion or portions have been claimed for the agriculturist.</p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Here and there may be seen the little fisherman craft,
"chugging" away from their moorings in the early dawn and
returning at the setting of the sun heavily laden with the famous
Columbia river salmon that feed thousands throughout the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
world. On sandbars or sand islands, of which there are many
in the lower part of the river, the "purse seiners" are conspicuous
and the horses dragging the nets strangled with the products
of the deep. In the deeper waters close to the shore, but
far from the sea, are the fish wheels whirling by the force of the
same waters that conceal the treasures being sought.</p>

<p>Cities appear at frequent intervals, both on the Washington
side and in Oregon. Before the entrance to the Snake River
is reached, one will have passed Ilwaco, Cathlamet, Kalama,
Vancouver, Camas, Washougal, Stevenson, White Salmon, and
Wallula on the Washington side, besides many important cities
on the Oregon shores: namely, Astoria, the site of the first settlement
on the Columbia; Portland, the largest city in Oregon,
near the mouth of the Willamette; and The Dalles, for many
years the head of navigation. Kennewick and Pasco are located
just beyond the mouth of the Snake River, ready to derive
full benefit from the improved navigation conditions of the
future. Between these larger towns is many a tiny hamlet,
while isolated farms and orchards surrounding pretty dwellings
slope gently towards the river and tend to make the traveler
dissatisfied with his own home.</p>

<p>At times is visible a beautiful waterfall, a palisade of wonderful
basalt, and occasionally some island draped with verdure
of many tints. Further away a murmuring brook or crystal
streamlet may be heard hurrying down a rocky hillside or winding
between towering cliffs, adding its share to the tuneful
sound of the powerful orchestra that seems everywhere to be
heard. Constantly shifting color and shade attract the eye and
tones of varying quality please the ear.</p>

<p>When the mouth of the Cowlitz is neared there appear,
stretching toward the north, broad areas where man has mingled
his skill with Nature's works. Green fields, sometimes fringed
with willows, near the waterfront, and dotted with orchards, farm
houses, and dairies, are visible as far as the eye can see.
These evidences of man's encroachments are noted all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
way to Vancouver (and beyond), at which city, the oldest in
the state, a tourist should linger long enough to appreciate the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
region which arrested the attention of our earliest settlers and
inspired the beginning of the first city in Washington. A
bridge, costing nearly two million dollars, will soon connect it
with the beautiful city of Portland.</p>

</div>

<p>Cultivated lands are seen on either side as the river is
ascended, until the mountainous region is reached and the roar
of the cascades is distinctly heard. These cascades, according
to Indian lore, were created by the falling of the
"Bridge of the Gods," which once extended from shore to shore
and formed the great highway connecting the mountains on
the north and their extension to the south, while beneath a
mighty river peacefully pursued its course to the sea. The perpendicular
buttresses on either hand, the forest areas that
apparently fell from above, trees growing out of the water,
petrified logs up in the reddish cliffs within the vicinity of Stevenson,
and many other freaks of nature all seem to strengthen
the evidence on which this story is based.</p>

<p>Throughout the mountainous region are wonderful examples
of Nature's diverse skill. Among the most striking are Castle
Rock, or Wehatpolitan's gravestone, a great basaltic rock 900
feet high; St. Peter's Dome, a sublime elevation of 2,000 feet,
considered one of the wonders of the American continent; Oneonta
Gorge, almost concealed behind towering rocks; Multnomah
Falls, a matchless waterfall with a sheer drop of 800 feet; Cape
Horn, a long palisade of basalt; Rooster Rock, unsurpassed for
beauty of form and variety of color; and Cape Eternity, a massive
precipice 1,000 feet in height.</p>

<p>Thorough appreciation of the surrounding charms necessitates
climbing some of the neighboring hills, or traveling over
the wooded river banks and visiting the rustic towns that lie at
the foot of the mountains and guard the gateway to the alluring
valleys. Near Stevenson, county seat of Skamania county, overlooking
the cascade locks, and Carson, are several hot springs
where accommodations for the most particular are available.
From these towns one may follow the Wind River Valley to its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
source beyond the headquarters of the rangers where the U. S.
forest nurseries are maintained. A few miles further are the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Government Hot Springs, near which many low peaks, easy for
climbing, offer expansive views of the surrounding country.</p>

<p>A twenty-five mile drive up the famous White Salmon Valley
takes one to Trout Lake, not far from the ice and lava caves
in the foothills of Mount Adams, and near Huckleberry Mountain,
a pow-wow place for the Indians. On the way, hundreds of
scientifically developed orchards, and oat fields yielding over 100
bushels to the acre, are passed; also the Northwest Electric Company's
power plant, which, generating 20,000 horse power,
supplies power to cities seventy-five miles away. From the massive
bluffs of White Salmon a panorama of perfectly blending
color may be seen, formed by the unusual combination of the Columbia
River and the mountains to the east and the west, while
the entire Hood River Valley, with Mount Hood beyond, is
visible on the Oregon side.</p>

<p>The trip from Lyle to Goldendale along the Klickitat River
is a journey of surprises. The railroad follows the winding
canyon past pretty waterfalls, crosses hurrying brooks, and
emerges finally into a wide, fertile plain overlooking the Columbia
basin. Fields of waving grain and other products exhibit
the richness of the Klickitat valley. Those desiring can motor
from Goldendale into the Yakima valley or return to the Columbia
via Maryhill, where Hon. Samuel Hill has built a $100,000
road across his 6,000-acre farm.</p>

<p>Nor do all the wonders belong to the lower Columbia. Before
being joined by the Snake River, it has drained a region
noted for agricultural superiority and contributed liberally to
the needs of irrigation. The "Big Bend" on the left, and the
valleys watered by its tributaries from the right, are described
under the chapter entitled "The Inland Empire."</p>

<p>Following its channel still farther towards the source, wilder
scenes are met with, the gorges are deeper, the cascades noisier,
native trees more plentiful, waterfalls higher, and the course
of the stream more winding. Startling phenomena appear in
rapid succession, and scenes unimagined will astonish the tourist
who spends a little time in re-exploring this great river, for
ages a prize eagerly sought by the searchers for the unknown.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Thousands of years ago, scientists tell us, there existed between
the Rocky Mountains and the Cascade range a vast inland
sea&mdash;the waters left imprisoned when the ocean had receded.
After many ages these pent up waters burst the restraining
barriers and forced their way to the ocean, creating the deep
canyon of the Columbia, but leaving behind a broad plain, now
known as the Inland Empire.</p>

<p>What was once a desolate waste, however, has been transformed
into a "Land of Canaan." Its plateaus unite to form one
of the bountiful "bread baskets of the world" while its valleys
yield generously of nearly all the products of husbandry. Near
its borders the mountains, with their retinue of trees, flowers
and grassy meadows, reach as far as the invisible power permits
and then dispatch their emissaries, the rivers, to wind through
and through and distribute the welcome waters that enkindle the
irrigated districts with life and activity.</p>

<p>Far beyond the boundaries of our own state spreads this
wonderful plain, but the brief description contemplated in these
few pages must be confined chiefly to Washington. The curious
sight-seer or the serious homeseeker can well afford to spend
many days exploring this region, marveling at both the mighty
forces of creation and the embellishments of man. Under far
more pleasant circumstances can it be traversed now than when
the early pioneers first fought their way over the mountains.
Lewis and Clarke, the Hudson's Bay Company men, and Marcus
Whitman, supplemented their sturdy limbs and indomitable
courage with the trusty saddle horse, the slow prairie schooner
or the rude river raft. Today the palatial cars of four trans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>continental
lines make daily trips across the state; branch lines
accommodate the territory north and south; and parts not
reached by rail are served by well constructed thorofares.</p>

<div class='center'><br />CHIEF FEATURES.</div>

<p>In addition to the Columbia river basin, the most important
features are the Yakima and Wenatchee valleys; the Lake Chelan
region; the Okanogan Highlands with the valleys of the
Methow, Okanogan, San Poil, Colville and Pend Oreille;
the Spokane Country; the Walla Walla valley; the Snake
River; the Big Bend and Palouse wheat sections with their
"coulees"; and the Blue Mountains. There are also a few low
bare ridges of a semi-mountainous character which relieve the
prairie effect and permit cycloramic views of the surrounding
territory. Among these are the Saddle Mountains, the Simcoe
Hills, and the Horse Heaven Plateau; while a number of spurs
from the Cascades, including the Wenatchee Mountains, help
form the fertile valleys to the west of the plain.</p>


<div class='center'><br />HOW TO REACH THEM.</div>

<p>These different sections may be easily reached from almost
any city in the state. Visitors coming by way of Spokane can
make a quick yet comprehensive survey of eastern Washington
in two ways. After seeing the immediate Spokane vicinity and
visiting the Pend Oreille Valley to the north, either automobiles
or Great Northern trains will convey them up the Colville
Valley to the junction of the Kettle and Columbia rivers,
whence the trip may be continued to Republic by train, and
down the San Poil by auto. At Republic trains connect for Oroville,
whence the journey may be continued to Wenatchee down
the Okanogan Valley, both by auto and rail. Side trips may be
taken up the Methow Valley and the Lake Chelan canyon, as
well as to numerous other places of interest. From Wenatchee
the Great Northern railway or the Sunset Highway insures
an interesting ride back to Spokane through the wheat fields of
the Big Bend. The southern half of the region will be seen by
making a tour through the Palouse to the Snake River and
Walla Walla country. Transportation leads from there direct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to the Columbia River, and the Yakima and Kittitas valleys.
The Horse Heaven may be reached from Kennewick and Pasco,
or from Prosser.</p>


<p>The other plan reverses the order. After visiting the
Palouse, Snake River, Walla Walla, Yakima, and Kittitas
valleys, from Ellensburg a scenic overland route may be taken
direct for Wenatchee, whence a loop may be made to include
Lake Chelan and the Okanogan Highlands, the Big Bend and
the Spokane Country.</p>


<div class='center'><br />THE YAKIMA VALLEY.</div>

<p>Broadly speaking, the Yakima Valley includes all the rich
territory tributary to the Yakima River, reaching from Lakes
Keechelus and Kachees, its sources in the Cascades, to the
Columbia&mdash;a total distance of nearly 175 miles with a range of
altitude, at the water's edge, varying from 2,250 down to 340
feet. It embraces, besides the Yakima Valley proper, the Kittitas
and a number of minor valleys, including the Naches, the
Ahtanum, the Cowiche, the Selah, the Wenas, the Satus and
the Toppenish. These last two belong to the rich country just
south of "Union Gap," where Sunnyside and Toppenish are
located, two enterprising cities, vieing for supremacy over the
rich south half of Yakima county. Further south is Prosser,
county seat of Benton county. Above the Gap is North Yakima
with a population of 18,000, the metropolis of the region
and home of the State Fair; while Ellensburg, with 6,500 people,
is Queen of the Kittitas Valley. The south half of Yakima
county constitutes the Indian Reservation where the Yakima
Tribes dwell peaceably by the side of the whites, tilling the
soil and occasionally entertaining the people with many a
"Round Up," or Wild West Show. At Fort Simcoe is their
school, deserving of a visit from anyone interested.</p>

</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>In this valley, where once was nothing but sage brush and
bunch grass, is irrigable land enough to support a population
of a million people; for the total water capacity as surveyed by
the United States Government is estimated at 927,000 acre
feet, sufficient to water 600,000 acres. Less than a third of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
is at present cultivated and watered from small canals, built by
private capital, and from the two largest ones in the state, constructed
by the U. S. Reclamation Service. These latter are
the Tieton, with water sufficient for 34,500 acres, and the Sunnyside,
capable of irrigating 100,000 acres.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 275px;">
<img src="images/illo_p067.jpg" width="275" height="217" alt="A HOME NEAR ELLENSBURG." title="" />
<span class="caption">A HOME NEAR ELLENSBURG.</span>
</div>

<p>A journey along the banks of these canals or the Yakima
river unfolds a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'panaroma'">panorama</ins> of unusual breadth and interest. Instead
of the heavy
forests of the west
side, the sage brush
struggles for existence
just above the
main ditches; but the
country below is
checkered with orchards,
farms, and
gardens; and cotton
woods protect
the banks of the
streams. Impressive
is the sight in springtime
when fruit trees are all in bloom and the Blossom Festival,
participated in by a hundred-thousand people, is ushering in
the full tide of spring; or in autumn when deeper touches of
color mark an immense crop ready for the harvester.</p>


<p>From the hills on either side, the picture assumes its most
perfect form. Cities, meadows, orchards, vineyards, hop fields,
vegetable gardens, alfalfa farms, corn fields, and prairies, bisected
and crisscrossed by railroads, highways, canals, and
rivers, protected by the brown hills near by and watched over
by the mountains in the distance, supply composition for
pictures that in detail and variety must discourage all competition.</p>


<div class='center'><br />THE WENATCHEE VALLEY.</div>

<p>Equally beautiful but of smaller dimensions is the Wenatchee
Valley, reaching from the Columbia well up into the foot
hills of the Cascades. This, too, was a desolate brown slope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
until the effects of irrigation were felt on its rich volcanic ash
soil. After that only ten years were necessary to convert it
into a garden of dazzling splendor. Instead of the forlorn
looking sagebrush, a maze of orchards, extending up the valley
and ascending the hills, presents in springtime a solid mass of
blossoms, varying from purest white to daintiest shades of pink.
Serpentining along the hill sides, as if protecting the gardens
below, are the great viaducts, conducting the precious waters
that irrigate the land; while dodging from one side of the vale
to the other, or paralleling the Great Northern Railroad, the
Wenatchee river hastens onward towards the Columbia.</p>

<p>The north, south, and west are guarded by forest-covered
hills, spurs of the Cascades, over which many trails lead to
charming mountain lakes and streams, where summer homes
are maintained, and game awaits the hunter. The east opens
up toward the wheat fields of the Big Bend, while the Columbia
River Valley to the north and south is tributary and joins in all
the enterprises of the district. Every tiny tributary stream in
the vicinity marks the location of a peaceful home supported
in affluence by successful fruit culture or gardening.</p>

<p>Within this valley are several prosperous cities, including
Wenatchee, the metropolis of north central Washington, with
a population of about 5,000, at the junction of the Wenatchee
and Columbia rivers; Leavenworth near the head of the valley;
and Cashmere, midway between the two. The pervading spirit
is one of optimism and liberality, for the Wenatchee red apple
is famous the world o'er and nets its producers $5,000,000 annually.</p>


<div class='center'><br />LAKE CHELAN.</div>

<p>Chelan, "Beautiful Water," is the name of one of the grandest
sheets of fresh water reposing upon the bosom of the American
continent. It is one of a number of beautiful lakes found
throughout the highlands in the vicinity of the upper Columbia,
but on account of its thrilling beauty and easy approach has
become one of the favorite resorts for the entire northwest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption"><a href="images/illo_p069-big.jpg">THE WENATCHEE VALLEY&mdash;NEAR THE CITY OF WENATCHEE.</a><br />Photo by Curtis &amp; Miller.</span>
</div>

<p>It is reached usually via the city of Wenatchee, but sometimes
from the Columbia and Okanogan valleys on the north.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>River boats, automobile stages, or Great Northern trains allow
three principal modes of transportation, each of which reveals
different scenes of interest. During summer months the overland
trip is undoubtedly the most pleasant and presents the
fullest opportunity for appreciating the scenery. The return
might be by river boat or train, necessitating a ride down the
Chelan gorge, where the river drops 400 feet in its brief course
of four miles, and furnishes at low water 125,000 horsepower.</p>


<p>Surpassing the canyons of the Yosemite, the Yellowstone,
the Columbia, and the Colorado, the total depth of the Chelan
canyon reaches in places nearly 8,000 feet, while its waters
occasionally cover a bottom 1,700 feet below the surface.
Throughout the 55 mile ride from Chelan to Stehekin, views
are observed that for immensity, sublimity and color blending
are unexcelled. Right into the heart of the Cascades the
traveler is drawn, while the solemnity and general impressiveness
of the whole increases, as he is gradually brought in closer intimacy
with divine nature. Among features of striking scenic
importance are Railroad Creek, descending 6,000 feet in 20
miles, the Stehekin River, and Rainbow Falls.</p>


<div class='center'><br />THE OKANOGAN HIGHLANDS.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 345px;">
<img src="images/illo_p071.jpg" width="345" height="600" alt="THE OKANOGAN AND METHOW VALLEYS." title="" />
<span class="caption"><a href="images/illo_p071-big.jpg">THE OKANOGAN AND METHOW VALLEYS.</a></span>
</div>
<p>This region consists of low picturesque mountains, alternating
with fertile valleys and studded with lakes protected by open
forests of spruce, pine, and tamarac. Opportunities for the
homeseeker, pleasure for the sportsman, and continuous scenes
of interest for the tourist are suggested. Here one can yet feel
the presence of the true western spirit of frontiership, for this
part of the state was the last to be thrown open to settlers; and
the Indians are still in full possession of the Colville Indian
reservation, comprising some 1,300,000 acres in the south
central part of the section, extending from the Okanogan river
to the eastern boundary of Ferry county. Under irrigation the
valleys yield liberally of fruits, vegetables and dairy products,
and the higher lands are devoted to grain and stock raising.
Lumbering plays its part and mining for precious metals assumes
greater importance than elsewhere in the state.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The valleys of the Pend Oreille, the Colville, the Kettle, and
the Okanogan rivers, are now served by rail; but the San Poil
and the Methow are dependent on highway conveyances. Of
extreme interest is the ride from Spokane up the Colville and
Kettle River valleys to Oroville, with a short side trip to Republic,
the leading gold producing city in the state. The railroad
crosses the boundary line several times, enforcing the
unique experience of being at one moment under the dominion
of King George of England and the next back under the Stars
and Stripes. Cultivated valleys, broad wheat fields, and picturesque
canyons are invaded before arriving at the heights from
which Oroville appears far below&mdash;requiring an hour for the
train to descend by a series of remarkable switchbacks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption"><a href="images/illo_p072-big.jpg">COLVILLE VALLEY, SIX MILES NORTHWEST OF COLVILLE.</a></span>
</div>

<p>Most of the towns in the Okanogan Highlands are still in
their infancy, for its development has been so recent; but therein
lies much of its charm. In the Pend Oreille Valley the leading
city is Newport, the county seat, prettily located on both
sides of the river, half in Idaho and half in Washington. In
Stevens county are Chewelah, a mining town, and Colville, the
largest city in the region, with a population of over 1,500 people.
A place that attracts tourists for miles is St. Mary's Indian
Mission on the Colville Indian Reservation near Omak. Other
interesting towns are scattered throughout the four counties.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>From the city of Spokane all corners of the Inland Empire
are easily reached. Five transcontinental lines enter the city
and two others operate trains; while a network of electric lines
serves the immediate vicinity, penetrating the territory as
far south as Colfax, Palouse, and Moscow; southwest to Medical
Lake and Cheney; and eastward to Hayden Lake and Coeur
d'Alene. Highways have been built through the most scenic
sections along the river valleys and up into the mountains. Each
mode of transportation unfolds a different panorama. The hills
nearest Spokane are covered with a dense growth of pine. Farther
away are forests of pine, fir, cedar, and tamarac, concealing
many lakes teeming with trout and black bass. Within a
radius of a hundred miles are fifty mountain lakes, thirty-eight
of which are ideally located and supplied with all necessary equipment
for camping. They include Pend Oreille, the second largest
fresh water lake in the United States, fifty miles east; Hayden
Lake, forty miles east in the heart of the Idaho National
Forest Reserve; Chatcolet Lake, thirty-two miles distant;
Liberty Lake, seventeen miles; Priest Lake, seventy-eight miles;
Spirit Lake, forty-three miles; Coeur d'Alene, thirty-two miles;
and Twin Lakes, thirty-three miles.</p>

<p>The mountains are visible either to the north or the east.
They are neither as lofty nor as rugged as the Cascades and
Olympics, but they are nevertheless beautiful. The highest peak
in eastern Washington is Mount Spokane, 5,808 feet, twenty
miles northeast of the city. From its summit one may look out
into the three northwestern states of Oregon, Idaho and Washington,
and into the province of British Columbia; and count
seventeen different lakes and rivers.</p>

<p>Towards the north are the Okanogan Highlands with the
valleys of the Pend Oreille and Colville, while the Bitter Root
mountains are approached on the east. The roads westward
and southward lead past well cultivated gardens, green meadows
and groves, until finally is spread before one a sea of grain&mdash;continuous
wheat fields&mdash;the Big Bend to the west and the Palouse
to the south.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Towards the east the "Apple Way," one of the most remarkable
roads in America on account of the high class material of
which it is constructed, enters the Spokane Valley, crosses
the state of Idaho and connects with roads leading to the National
Parks in Montana. This valley more than thirty miles in
length, with an average width of eight miles, comprises a level
irrigated country cut up into intensive garden and orchard
tracts. Thousands are supported in affluence by raising apples,
pears, cherries, small
fruits, garden truck,
poultry, and live
stock. The advantages
of abundant
water power, proximity
to a great city,
rapid transit facilities,
and a healthful
climate, are quickly
transforming the region
into one of attractive
suburban
homes.</p>


<p>The Spokane River
drops 1,280 feet in a
distance of 100 miles,
and 130 feet within
the city limits, falling
precipitously
70 feet in the heart of the business section, over a dam
200 feet wide. On both sides is built the city sloping towards
its waters and overlooking the country beyond. Extensive
economic developments are taking place, there being seven
distinct projects under way which involve expenditures of nearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
$35,000,000. These include railroad construction, power
plants, manufacturing and business blocks, and hotels for tourists.
Historical events are associated with Fort George
Wright, named for a famous Indian fighter; Indian Canyon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
tribal home of Spokane Indians; Mount Spokane, a pow-wow
place for Indian tribes; Fort Spokane, one of the first government
Indian posts; Old Block House, a protection for the early
fur traders; and Steptoe Butte, the scene of a famous battle.</p>

</div>


<div class='center'><br />THE WHEAT PLATEAU.</div>

<p>The wheat belt includes principally the area within the big
bend of the Columbia river, the "Big Bend Country," which
stretches eastward until it blends with the rolling Palouse, one
of the richest farm regions in the northwest, and southeast
across the Snake River to the Blue Mountains; although considerable
wheat is raised in the country lying between the
Columbia and the Cascades, as well as in the four counties to
the north. The green carpet is visible, in spring, and the
waving heads of yellow grain, in summer, extending away to the
horizon. The combined harvester, drawn by thirty-six horses,
is a familiar example of the immensity of the machinery needed
when gathering the mammoth crop, which for the entire state
is in the neighborhood of 50,000,000 bushels annually.</p>

<p>The Big Bend is broken in places by "coulees" or old river
courses, sometimes 500 to 600 feet in depth, where irrigation is
practiced and where strings of small alkali lakes have been
scattered. Two of the most important are Moses Coulee in
Douglas county, and Grand Coulee forming the boundary line
between Douglas and Grant counties, said to be the old bed of
the Columbia. Almost surrounded by the wheat belt lies the
Quincy Valley, containing 435,000 acres of level fertile land
to be some day irrigated by water conducted under the Columbia
river from Wenatchee Lake in Chelan county.</p>

<p>The best known lakes include Soap Lake, a health resort,
Moses Lake, near which irrigation from wells is successfully
carried on, and Rock Lake, a rock bound sheet of water in the
Palouse. The most important river is the Palouse which
creates the Palouse Falls just before joining the Snake River.
Near this stream are several prosperous cities, including Colfax,
Palouse, and Pullman, the home of the State College and Experiment
Station.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

</div>

<div class='center'><br />THE WALLA WALLA COUNTRY.</div>

<p>The Snake river, largest tributary of the Columbia, with a
canyon of 1,500 feet, cuts this plateau in two, and forms a natural
dividing line between Whitman and Franklin counties on the
north, and Walla Walla, Columbia, Garfield, and Asotin on the
south. Its warm canyon is famous for early fruits and berries
which are shipped in carloads to eastern and western points.</p>

<p>Fields of wheat, barley or rye extend southward in all
four counties to the Blue Mountains, interrupted occasionally
by orchards which assume their greatest proportions in the
beautiful Touchet and Walla Walla valleys. Over this rich
country the fair city of Walla Walla reigns supreme, her authority
being limited only by the Columbia and Snake rivers, or
the Blue Mountains; although Waitsburg, Dayton, Pomeroy
and Clarkston are important centers in their own districts.</p>

<p>Steeped in historical associations is this valley, from Wallula,
the site of the first Hudson's Bay fort, to the city of Walla
Walla. When once seen, no words are needed to tell why these
lovely plains, all ready for the planting and moistened with
sufficient rainfall annually, were so attractive to the early settlers,
and inspired the first serious efforts at colonization.</p>


<div class='center'><br />THE COLUMBIA RIVER.</div>

<p>All waters of eastern Washington reach the ocean through
the Columbia river, uniting the entire region in one spirit of fraternity.
The grandest and most reaching scenic feature of the
region, it supplies unlimited water for successful irrigation and
power purposes, and in places still provides the principal mode
of transportation. Between Kettle Falls and the Snake river are
a number of important rapids, chief of which is Priest Rapids,
just below Saddle Gap, ten miles long with a descent of seventy
feet and a possible horse power of half a million.</p>

<p>Just above the mouth of the Snake river are the cities of
Kennewick and Pasco, ready to profit by direct navigation to
the sea as soon as the Celilo locks are completed. At the lowest
elevation in the Inland Empire and surrounded by a large area
of irrigable land, they are served by three transcontinental railroads,
permitting rapid transit to any part of the northwest.</p>

<p>The state of Washington is rapidly developing a system of
roads which, finally consummated, will rival in skillful engineering
and commercial importance the French highways, and in
scenic grandeur the mountain passes of Switzerland. Easy approaches
are being constructed to every town and hamlet and
into every farming community. So vigorously has the work
been pushed that Washington now outranks every other state,
except Colorado, in the facility and directness with which its
mountain recesses may be reached. Upwards of 50,000 miles
have been already completed, presenting altogether a labyrinth
of broad thorofares, boulevards, and country highways. The
most important highways built and maintained at state expense
are the Pacific, the Sunset, the Inland Empire, the Olympic and
the National Park.</p>


<div class='center'><br />THE PACIFIC HIGHWAY.</div>

<p>The Pacific Highway extends from the southern limit of the
state of California to Vancouver, British Columbia, twenty-seven
miles north of Washington's boundary line, a total distance of
about two thousand miles. Three hundred and fifty miles is within
the state of Washington, connecting Vancouver on the Columbia
with Blaine at the international line. It traverses nine counties
of Washington, containing forty-eight per cent of the wealth
and fifty-five per cent of the population, and passes through nine
county seats, including Olympia, the state capital, Vancouver,
Kalama. Chehalis, Tacoma, Seattle, Everett, Mount Vernon and
Bellingham.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>From Vancouver, Washington, this highway starts northward
through the prune and plum orchards of Clarke county, where
more of these trees grow than in all other parts of the state
combined. Along the banks of the historic Columbia and through
the fertile valley of the Cowlitz, it winds toward Kelso, famous
for smelt fisheries; and Castle Rock, the gateway to Mount St.
Helens. Deviating to the right at Vader, the north fork of the
picturesque Chehalis is soon reached, which fertile valley is followed
to the cities of Chehalis and Centralia, two rapidly
growing railroad centers having a combined population of
15,500 people. Groves, orchards, gardens and prairies line the
smooth gravelly road from here to Olympia, where the first view
of Puget Sound is obtained. The desire to swerve off toward
Grays Harbor or the Olympic Peninsula by the newly completed
Olympic Highway, or to try the steamer on the peaceful Sound,
is with difficulty overcome; but the Pacific Highway finally wins
and draws one on toward Tacoma, thirty-two miles northeast.
Rising above the famous Nisqually flats, and descending again to
cross the oak moor lands marking the beginning of Tacoma's
playgrounds and reminding one of southern England, the road
soon enters Tacoma, third city in population in the state.</p>

<p>Along the Puyallup and White river valleys, the course leads,
touching at Puyallup and Sumner, famous for berry culture;
at Auburn and Kent, centers of a rich dairy section; and at
Renton, bristling with manufacturing importance near the
southern end of beautiful Lake Washington. A dozen miles more
and you are on the streets of Seattle, metropolis of the northwest
and third city in size west of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>Northward the course continues. A broad paved road winds
along by Lake Washington to Bothel, passing several pretty
lakes, entering green woods, intersecting meadows, crossing
streamlets, rising to sightly plateaus and descending again to
peaceful valleys before it reaches Everett, a city of 32,000, located
on an eminence overlooking the waters of the Sound.</p>

<p>The next town reached is Marysville, whence the highway
skirts the Tulalip Indian reservation, crosses the Stillaguamish
river in the Sylvan Flats and enters Stanwood where a scenic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
road branches off to Camano Island. At Mount Vernon and Burlington,
where it intersects the Skagit county road leading from
Anacortes eastward to the mountains, one may appreciate the famous
Skagit Valley, the "Holland of the Northwest," where 173
bushels of oats to the acre have been yielded on land protected
from the sea and river by immense dykes.</p>

<p>Within ten miles of Bellingham the Water Front Road is
reached, said to be the most picturesque on the entire route: for
the Sound is plainly seen from the shaded highway which clings
to the side of Chuckanut Mountain, while the electric interurban
and the Great Northern railway traverse the waterfront below.
Bellingham, a city of 30,000, has innumerable attractions to hold
the tourist, who still has twenty miles' journey if he would follow
the Pacific Highway to the Washington limit at Blaine, the most
northwesterly municipality in the United States. Near by is the
Whatcom County Government Farm, the only one in the northwest;
where bulb growing rivals the same industry in Holland.</p>


<div class='center'><br />SUNSET HIGHWAY.</div>

<p>The Sunset Highway is the only route at present permitting
through automobile traffic across the Cascade mountains and
connecting the western with the eastern counties. Throughout
its full four hundred miles from Seattle to Spokane it introduces
the tourist to scenes which for diversity and pleasant surprises,
varying from rugged mountains and roaring waterfalls to
peaceful irrigated valleys or broad wheat plains, can nowhere
be duplicated. With the exception of a few miles the grades are
never more than five per cent.</p>

<p>Branching off from the Pacific Highway at Renton, it rises
northeastward to the headwaters of the Snoqualmie River. Just
below the town of Snoqualmie appear the wonderful falls of the
same name, the "Niagara of the West." This immense stream
of water falling 268 feet, is now harnessed to supply power and
light to the cities and towns of Puget Sound. Following the
banks of this river the highway penetrates entrancing forests
and exposes many a remarkable panorama. Both road and river
are at times clearly visible from the Chicago-Milwaukee trains
puffing towards the summit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Descending, the road leads southeast along the headwaters of
the Yakima, and skirts the eastern banks of beautiful Lake
Keechelus, where the government is building a huge dam for
storing water to irrigate the Kittitas and Yakima valleys. Passing
the southern extremity of Lake Kachees, another deep
mountain lake, it soon passes Cle Elum, a coal shipping center,
enters the broad Kittitas valley and reaches the cultured city of
Ellensburg, mistress of the section and home of one of the state
normals.</p>

<p>The route is now northeastward over Table Mountain by a
5,200-foot pass, permitting an excellent view of Mounts Rainier
and Hood. The banks of the Columbia are followed to Wenatchee,
the metropolis of north central Washington and the
famous red apple district. Crossing the Columbia it proceeds
along its east bank to Orondo, whence, plunging through a winding
canyon, it rises rapidly to the great wheat plateau of the Big
Bend, which bursts suddenly upon the view. Leaving Waterville,
the county seat of Douglas county, it turns abruptly eastward
to continue in an almost unbroken line through expansive
wheat fields towards Spokane, the metropolitan city of the Inland
Empire, over a hundred miles away.</p>

<p>At Coulee City, forty miles from Waterville, it would be worth
while to linger long enough to explore the Grand Coulee, said to
be the old bed of the Columbia. Full of strange features, it has
attracted attention from geographers of international reputation.
Wilbur, Davenport, the county seat of Lincoln county,
and Reardan, besides many smaller settlements, almost lost in
the midst of the great wheat fields, appear before the thin
woods shading the approach into Spokane are reached.</p>


<div class='center'><br />INLAND EMPIRE HIGHWAY.</div>

<p>At Ellensburg the Sunset Highway connects with the Inland
Empire Road, a southern route to Spokane via Walla
Walla. Following the Wenas Valley to North Yakima, it continues
southeast through the Union Gap and along the Sunnyside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Canal, the largest irrigation ditch in the state, where a
splendid view of the valley, with Mount Hood in the distance appears.
From Prosser, county seat of Benton county and entrance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to the Horse Heaven country, the road drops toward the
Columbia river and soon reaches Kennewick, the home of early
strawberries, and Pasco, county seat of Franklin county.</p>

</div>

<p>From here the Central Washington Highway threads the extensive
wheat fields toward the northeast, passing through Connell,
Lind, Ritzville, and Sprague, all important wheat shipping
centers; and Cheney, the site of another state normal, fifteen
miles southwest from the city of Spokane.</p>

<p>The Inland Empire Highway leads on to the beautiful city
of Walla Walla; but at Dayton, the quaint county seat of Columbia
county, it divides, uniting again near Rosalia, twenty-five
miles south of Spokane. The shorter route trends northeast,
crosses the Snake at Pataha and passes through Colfax,
county seat of Whitman county, in the rich Palouse Valley. The
other branch penetrates extensive barley and wheat fields, enters
Pomeroy, county seat of Garfield county, and Clarkston, on the
eastern boundary line, named for the great explorer. Bending
northward it transects irrigated lands and wheat fields; enters
Pullman, home of the State College, Palouse, Garfield and Oakesdale;
joins the other branch at the county boundary line and
soon reaches the southern outskirts of Spokane.</p>

<p>From Spokane this road presses northward through the
Colville Valley to the Columbia, and thence to the international
boundary line, having previously passed at Deer Park the
Arcadia orchard, largest commercial apple orchard in the world;
Loon Lake, a summer resort; Chewelah, a mining town surrounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
by a dairying country; and Colville, county seat of
Stevens county and largest city in this section. A pleasant
contrast is this northern extension, regaining the mountains
and evergreen forests, the swiftly flowing rivers with glorious
waterfalls, and the chains of lakes adorning irrigated vales and
green meadows.</p>

<p>The Olympic Highway, when the few miles from Bogachiel
to Lake Quiniault, overlooking the Pacific Ocean, are completed,
will form a complete loop around the Olympic Peninsula, from
which it derives its name. Winding along at the foot of the
mountains, it connects the leading cities of the district and exposes
some of the most scenic features of the Sound country,
including Hood Canal, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Grays Harbor,
and occasionally
the Pacific
Ocean. The
principal cities
touched at are
Shelton, Port
Townsend, Port
Angeles, Hoquiam,
Aberdeen,
Elma and
Olympia.</p>


<p>The National Park Highway extends from Tacoma to Rainier
National Park, whence it bears southward to the headwaters
of the Cowlitz, crosses to the Chehalis Valley and, after connecting
with Chehalis and Centralia, leads southwest, over the low
coast range to Raymond and South Bend on Willapa Bay,
and from there continues to the mouth of the Columbia.</p>

<p>Other scenic routes are planned to cross the Cascade mountains.
Two are nearly completed, viz., the McClellan Pass
Highway, paralleling the Sunset as far as North Yakima, and
one along the north bank of the Columbia. A third will sometime
cross and connect the Skagit Valley with the Methow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>This book cannot expect to win the largest measure of approval
from the followers of Nimrod unless a few paragraphs
are devoted to the opportunities for the chase and the plentifulness
of game fish and birds. Of course, the real sportsman would
rather discover the prey for himself. To tell minutely where
every prize is to be found would be like disclosing the end of an
interesting story before the beginning had been read. But even
if it were well to do so, every page in this publication would be
needed just to mention each stream and lake containing fish,
every coppice concealing fowl, and every wood protecting the
quarry.</p>

<p>That the common species of game are plentiful is superfluous
to say. On holidays and at week ends, during the open
season, it is a familiar sight to witness the khaki-suited brave
looking sportsmen, with guns or fish baskets and rods, clambering
onto the trains or hiking to the nearest point where the
welcome woods and the realm of habitation meet. It is equally
common to behold this same army of hunters trailing along at
the close of the holiday, burdened with fish of many species,
vari-colored fowl, or the hides of various game animals.</p>

<p>Game birds are very prolific. Among the most prominent
are the Chinese pheasant, bob white and California quail, Hungarian
partridge, and native prairie chickens; all are found
along the streams or in the clearings and fields of nearly every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
part of the state. Blue grouse are quite plentiful in western
Washington and in the wooded sections of eastern Washington.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Ruffled grouse are plentiful in the Okanogan Highlands and in
several of the western counties. All species of ducks are to be
found on Puget Sound and along the rivers and lakes tributary
thereto, also along many streams and lakes of the Inland Empire;
while geese infest the Columbia and Snake river regions in
eastern Washington.</p>

<p>Perhaps no state in the Union has as many varieties of real
fighting trout as Washington; including especially the mountain,
rainbow, cut throat, beardsley, crawford, lake, steel head,
and eastern brook, in all lakes and mountain streams. Black bass
and perch are very plentiful in the land-locked lakes; and certain
sections produce also many varieties of white fish, sun fish,
croppies and cat fish. The waters of Puget Sound, the harbors
and the Columbia River contain many species of salmon.</p>

<p>The commonest and most hunted large game is the deer,
found chiefly in the hills and mountains, although in some localities
it invades the domains of domestic animals. The leading
varieties noted are the mule and black tail, there being also a
few white tail. In the Olympic region are large herds of elk
and a few in the southwest and northeastern counties. These,
however, are temporarily protected by law. Mountain goat and
sheep are found in the rocky peaks of the Cascades; while the
black and brown bear are found in the wooded hills and mountains;
also occasionally cougars, wild cats, and wolves. These
latter, however, keep themselves far removed from the main traveled
roads; only by much care are they located, so that the
timid need have no fear of wandering in the woods alone.</p>

<p>In order to insure plenty of game at the right season of
the year, five trout hatcheries are supported by the state and a
number by separate counties. The state hatcheries alone planted
4,399,050 trout in 1913. The common birds are propagated
and set free at both public and private expense.</p>

<p>With nature's already liberal supply, and the state and
counties blending their united efforts to supplement and conserve,
the true sportsman will never regret casting his lot with
the state of Washington, where his outdoor propensities may be
encouraged to the fullest degree.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>The cities of Washington are all beautiful in their natural
setting, and reflect the originality, the energy and love for artistic
design of the people who dwell within them. In western
Washington they are usually protected by verdure covered hills,
and built to overlook the Sound, the harbors, or the rivers. The
smaller towns nestle close to pretty streams which supply power
and water. Snow capped mountains are always visible.</p>

<p>The east side cities are usually near the larger streams and
adorned with trees, both native and cultivated. Forests are lacking
in the Columbia River Plain, and the brown hills are continually
in sight. In the northern counties, however, the native
trees and mountains again become more prominent.</p>

<p>All cities are well provided with spacious and comfortable
hotels. Theaters, business blocks, school houses, churches, and
other public buildings are of modern structure; the streets are
generally paved; practically all have electric lights and pure
running water. The homes are planned both for beauty and
comfort, and are often surrounded by green lawns or gardens
where hundreds of species of beautiful flowers reach perfection.</p>

<p>The following pages are devoted to brief descriptions of the
larger centers, and the more important trips from each. They
are arranged to represent a tour about the state and in the
order in which one might visit all, or certain ones only, with
the least expenditure of time. The cities given have commercial
organizations prepared to give further information regarding
their respective localities.</p>

<p><b>SPOKANE:</b> Metropolis of the Inland Empire, and second largest
city in the state. Population about 136,000. Its growth was over 500<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
per cent in twenty years. Situated on both sides of the Spokane River
with wonderful waterfalls in heart of city. One of the leading railroad
centers in the west, it has five transcontinental lines operating
on their own tracks and two others over joint tracks. Its hotels,
theaters, public buildings, and homes, are among the most costly in
the northwest. Its fifty-two parks, comprising 1,933 acres valued at
more than $2,000,000, give the largest per capita park area of any city
in the United States. Splendid boulevards within the city connect with
broad highways leading to distant points in the Inland Empire. There
is a boating course two miles long above the city, a municipal bathing
pool a mile from the business center, and a zoo at Manito Park. One
may see large manufacturing establishments, irrigation, wheat fields,
and many big development projects within a limited area. It is the

<p><b>VANCOUVER:</b> Oldest city in state; settled in 1824 by the Hudson
Bay Company. It slopes gently towards the Columbia river, visible
from all points. To the north are the prune orchards for which Clarke
county is noted, and the English walnut seems to have found its ideal
habitat. Adjoining city are the Vancouver Barracks, occupying 640
acres of land, 300 of which constitute
a natural park with many winding
roads. State schools for the deaf and
the blind are located near. What is
said to be the oldest apple tree in the
Northwest still thrives. Electric
lines extend to the outlying districts,
also to Portland, Oregon, while auto
drives may be made along the river,
nowhere more picturesque, or
through the surrounding prosperous
farming districts.</p>

<p>When you have seen Washington, the vast territory of Alaska
awaits you. Alaska, the last of the undeveloped free empires!
This region is so extensive that even the state of Washington
would be lost in its midst, for its area is equal to that of
the original thirteen colonies, with Maine, Vermont, Ohio, Indiana,
Tennessee, Kentucky and Michigan thrown in, or one-fifth
of the entire United States. It has a range of latitude of
1,100 miles, while its extreme longitude would reach from the
Atlantic to the Pacific.</p>

<p>In proportion to its vastness, so are its wonders. Stupendous
mountains reach to three and nearly four miles in height,
loftier than any others in the United States or its possessions.
The Yukon River is 2,300 miles in length and its nearest rival,
1,000 miles. The biggest glaciers in North America are here,
which make those of Europe look like mere pygmies, and volcanoes
still in eruption may be viewed from a safe point. The
scenery produced by the green rock-bound fiords with the snowy
peaks beyond is truly magnificent.</p>

<p>It is also a great treasure house. By the end of 1914 there
had been produced, $540,000,000, or about 75 times the price
paid for its purchase, representing over $15,000.00 for each
white person now inhabiting it. Almost half was from gold mining
and within the last twenty years. The rest was from fisheries,
seals, furs, copper and silver&mdash;permanent resources of region.</p>

<p>Alaska is not cold and bleak like Labrador, although its latitude
is similar. The Japan current acts as it does on Washington
and as the Gulf Stream affects England. Both plant and
animal life flourish and about 100,000 square miles of land are
available for agricultural purposes.</p>

<p>To partially realize its glories take the inside passage trip
from Seattle&mdash;a thousand miles of calm sea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
